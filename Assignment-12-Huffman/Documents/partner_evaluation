Homework 12 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Anastasia Gonzalez
Partner: Mark Van der Merwe
Date:    April 24, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 10 hours

Partner Score: 3 - Partner did a fantastic job.

Group Analysis: We worked well together and had no conflicts between the two of us.

Our group worked/didn't work because... We evenly distribute the work and work in small increments 
throughout the whole week. We work together while coding. We had one person navigate and the 
other lead. It was a great way to get lots done quickly.
